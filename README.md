# VP_FinalProject

In which we study the problem of image deblurring with GANs by comparing three possible architecture designs:

- Pix2Pix by Phillip Isola et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf)
- DeblurGAN by Orest Kupyn et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07064.pdf)
- SRN-DeblurNet by Xin Tao et al. (http://www.xtao.website/projects/srndeblur/srndeblur_cvpr18.pdf)

Academic project for the Vision and Perception course held by professors Irene Amerini and Paolo Russo.
